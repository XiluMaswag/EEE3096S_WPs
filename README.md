This is the folder where my practical work for Embedded systems course, offered by the University of Cape Town's EEE department - third year level, can be found.

Practical one: Intro to communication protocol - SPI data transmission (via code review and some editing).

Practical two: TBU

Practical three: Basic Benchmarking experiment on Raspberrypi, comparing Python and C.

Practical four: Investigating Good Practices when working with Embedded Systems, for internal systems such as debouncing, callbacks, pull-up and pull-down logic and with external systems such as, Pulse-Width-Modulation, I2C and EEPROM

Practical five: Practical use of ADCs to understand performance metrics and the quantification thereof and the use of ADC data to acquire said ADC metrics.

Mini_Project: Problem-solving task. Configuring an Environment logger that monitors temperature, light, etc at varying levels.
