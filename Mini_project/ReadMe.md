# The project scenario is as follows:

Your uncle needs to monitor temperature and light levels at varying intervals, which needs to be adjusted by a button press. He also wants to enable and disable logging by 
pressing a second button. Your uncle has a spare system which they can use to log into the Pi remotely and monitor console output, which he lists as one of the requirements. 
However, they wish to also monitor the terrarium remotely when they are not there. Their son, who plays with Arduinos, has spoken a lot about Blynk for IoT devices. You decide to 
look into these options for remote monitoring.

The following requests were also made:
â€¢ the most recent 20 samples are stored on an EEPROM chip as backup, in the case that internet access is lost.
